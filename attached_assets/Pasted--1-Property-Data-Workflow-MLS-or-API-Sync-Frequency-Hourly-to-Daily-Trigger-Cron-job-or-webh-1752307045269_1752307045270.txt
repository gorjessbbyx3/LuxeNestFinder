Store in CDN (Cloudinary, Vercel Blob, AWS S3)

🕶️ Virtual Tour Embed
Automatically detect and embed Matterport / Cupix / 3D iframe

🌎 5. Interactive Map Workflow

Steps:

User moves map → triggers bounding box query

Query backend for listings in viewport

Add overlays: heatmaps, zoning, flood zones, AR layers

Animate markers, pin highlights, and price hovers

🔐 6. Access Control Workflow
For premium listings or private sales:

User tries to view gated listing

Trigger auth flow:

Email verification

Proof of funds upload

Signed NDA

If approved, unlock listing access + send alert to agent

🔄 7. Content/Blog Workflow (optional but SEO gold)
Realtor/owner drafts blog via CMS

System suggests title, keywords, and meta tags (AI-assisted)

Preview and publish → new route auto-generated (/insights/top-5-oceanfront-properties-kauai)

Auto-push to newsletter + social

📈 8. Analytics & Optimization Workflow
Trigger: Page load or user event

Data collected:

Pageviews, time on page

Listing saves, tours booked

Scroll depth and heatmaps

Pushed to: Plausible, Google Analytics, or custom dashboard

💡 Bonus: Set alerts when listings hit X views with no conversions — could trigger price review.

🧩 Final Workflow Tips
Use queues (e.g., BullMQ, AWS SQS) for async tasks like image processing or email sending.

Keep audit logs for changes in listings, lead interactions, etc.

Schedule nightly backups of DB + media.
