🏝️ 1. Hawaii-Specific Benefits Your CRM Should Provide
🧭 Geolocation-Aware Property Matching
Filter by island, zip, and micro-neighborhoods (Waikiki ≠ Kailua ≠ Lahaina)

“10 mins from beach,” “mountain view,” “on golf course” filters

Island-specific MLS integrations (e.g., HiCentral, Kauai MLS)

🗺️ Interactive Map-Based Search
Buyers want to see proximity to ocean, schools, and surf breaks

Use map + photo hybrid views with custom pins

Bonus: Overlay elevation or flood zone info (important in coastal zones)

💰 2. Tailored to the Local Buyer Profiles

CRM must support:

Time zone–aware scheduling
