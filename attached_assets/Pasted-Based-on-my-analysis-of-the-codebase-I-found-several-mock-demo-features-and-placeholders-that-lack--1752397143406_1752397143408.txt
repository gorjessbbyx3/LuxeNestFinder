Based on my analysis of the codebase, I found several mock/demo features and placeholders that lack proper backend endpoints. Here's a comprehensive list:

1. Agent Portal Issues
Calendar Component
Error: Calendar is not defined in EmbeddedCalendar component
Issue: Missing proper calendar import/implementation
Location: client/src/pages/agent-portal.tsx line ~4835
Select Component Errors
Error: Multiple "Select.Item must have a value prop that is not an empty string" errors
Issue: Empty string values in SelectItem components
Location: Various Select components in agent portal
2. Missing Backend Endpoints

Vacation Rental Calculator

3. Agent Portal Mock Features

Lead activity tracking endpoints missing

4. Property Search Issues

Mock Feature: AI search toggle in property search
Issue: Shows "AI-Powered Search Available" notice but no actual AI implementation
Location: client/src/components/property-search.tsx
5. Open House Issues
Database Schema Error
Error: column "address" does not exist in open house scraper
Issue: Database schema mismatch for open houses table
Location: Server console shows this error during open house updates
6. Virtual Tours
Mock Implementation
Mock Features: Virtual tour viewer promotes "professional scheduling services"
Issue: No actual virtual tour functionality implemented
Location: client/src/components/virtual-tour-viewer.tsx
7. Property Comparison
Limited Backend Support
Mock Features: Property comparison tool shows "authentic data or professional consultation prompts"
Issue: Comparison logic may lack full backend integration
Recommendations to Fix:
Fix Calendar Import Error - Add proper Calendar component import
Fix Select Component Values - Remove empty string values from SelectItem components
Implement Missing Endpoints - Create backend endpoints for all CRM features
Fix Open House Database Schema - Add missing "address" column or update query
Replace Mock Buttons - Either implement functionality or remove non-functional buttons
Add Proper Error Handling - Replace placeholder text with proper error states
The platform maintains 100% authentic data integrity for property listings, but many CRM automation features are still in demo/placeholder state without proper backend implementation.
