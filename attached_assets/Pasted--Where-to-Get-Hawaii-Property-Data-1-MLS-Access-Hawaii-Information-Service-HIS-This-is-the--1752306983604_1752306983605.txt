🌋 Where to Get Hawaii Property Data
1. 🧠 MLS Access: Hawaii Information Service (HIS)
This is the primary MLS covering most of Hawaii, including:

Oʻahu (via HiCentral MLS)

Big Island (via Hawaii Information Service)

Kauaʻi

Maui (via REALTORS® Association of Maui)

🔗 Links:

https://www.hicentral.com/ (Oʻahu-specific)

🔧 Access Options:
Licensed REALTORS® or affiliates only

API or RETS feed (some offer RESO Web API)

Requires subscription + approval

Data includes:

Listings (active, pending, sold)

Photos, video, virtual tour URLs

Property details, pricing, geo-coordinates

💡 Pro tip: Partner with a local agent/broker to access data legally if you're not licensed.

2. 🏛️ Hawaii State Public Records & Tax Parcel Data
You want raw real estate metadata? Go to the source.

🗂️ Available Data:

🧭 Use Case:
Build maps, layers, or overlays

Validate listing data or create public record lookups

Combine with listing data for richer profiles

3. 💻 Third-Party APIs (No License Needed)
If you don’t have MLS access or need rapid prototyping:

🟢 Estated – https://estated.com/
Property-level data nationwide (including Hawaii)

Owner history, valuations, lot details, permits

Simple REST API

🟢 ATTOM Data – https://www.attomdata.com/
Nationwide coverage, deep property + neighborhood info

Offers parcel, zoning, demographic, and foreclosure data

🟢 Zillow API (Unofficial) – Limited & not for production
Scraping their site is risky and against ToS

But it’s a quick hack for proof of concept

🟢 Realtor.com (RapidAPI wrapper) – https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/realtor
Scrapes public listing info via RapidAPI

May violate TOS — not for production use

🧪 Suggested Data Strategy for Your Site
Feature	Data Source	Notes
Active Listings	MLS (HIS, HiCentral)	Most reliable & legal
Property History	Estated or ATTOM	Use if no MLS access
Owner & Tax Info	Hawaii County RPT sites	Public & open
Maps/Boundaries	Hawaii State GIS Portal	Great for visuals
Virtual Tours	MLS media URLs or host your own	Custom 3D also possible

🔐 Licensing & Legal
If you plan to sell, monetize, or publicly distribute MLS listing data:

✅ DO:

Partner with a local broker

Sign a data license agreement

Comply with MLS display rules

🚫 DON’T:

Scrape MLS or Zillow blindly

Assume public listing = free to use

Use fake brokerage status — they check
